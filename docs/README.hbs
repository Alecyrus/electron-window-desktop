*This module only supports Windows*

electron-wallpaper allows you to insert a Window between the wallpaper and the desktop icons in Windows. User input interaction with the window is not possible, therefore this module is suitable if you wish to build a desktop dashboard application such as [Rainmeter](https://rainmeter.net) but use Electron and NodeJS.

Installation
------------

Install `electron-wallpaper` by running:

```sh
$ npm install --save electron-wallpaper
```

Native binaries for win, mac and linux are prebuilt and downloaded when the module is installed.
